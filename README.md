‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: WalletGen is designed for research and educational purposes. It should not be used for unauthorized access or malicious activities. Use it responsibly, and only on wallets that you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen utilizes industry-standard protocols such as [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin.  For EVM-based chains, it implements the [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing algorithm.

The core function involves generating various potential wallet addresses, and then validating the balance of each one. This is done either via real-time balance checks through publicly accessible blockchain explorers, or by comparing the generated addresses against pre-existing databases of wallets that are known to have funds. WalletGen's C++ foundation provides for significantly faster processing speeds, a key advantage over Python-based options, and performance is primarily determined by your CPU and GPU.

## Why Choose WalletGen for Crypto Recovery Phrase Retrieval?

Why wait for a slow solution? **WalletGen** is engineered for speed and efficiency, especially when you need to find your crypto recovery phrase.  Written in C++ and optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU usage, it delivers up to **10x faster** performance compared to many alternatives. Whether you are working to recover lost wallets, validating private key ranges, or aiming to reclaim your own digital assets, WalletGen provides you with the speed and effectiveness needed for recovery.

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** employs a brute-force method to search for wallets with a balance.

### Bitcoin (BTC) Wallet Search:

*   Start by pressing key `3` in the menu, or run `start_search_btc.bat` to search Bitcoin wallets via the internet. Note: this method may take longer, because it checks balances via blockchain explorers in real-time.
*   For a faster approach, press key `6` to search using the database. This is much faster because it compares generated wallets against a database of known addresses and their balances.

### EVM Wallet Search (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press `5` or run `start_search_evm.bat` to search EVM wallets via the internet. Balances are checked in real-time with blockchain explorers.
*   Press `6` to search EVM wallets using the database. This is faster, using a known database.

### Performance Considerations:

*   Your hardware affects search speed, especially the graphics card (GPU). Running multiple instances (1 to 4) can help.

Databases improve search efficiency by eliminating the need for blockchain queries for every generated wallet.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

If WalletGen finds a wallet with a balance:
*   It will **Stop** immediately.
*   The wallet details will be **Displayed** in the console.
*   Data is **Saved** in the `found_wallets.txt` file.

### How to Access the Funds?

1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the found wallet into a compatible crypto wallet (such as Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Electrum).
2.  You can then transfer the funds to your own wallet.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen can help you recover your Bitcoin wallet using the seed phrase. You can input the complete phrase or use wildcards to search for missing words.

### Process Description

#### Search for Missing Words:

If you have missing words, use an *. WalletGen searches all possible combinations to find your phrase.

#### Entering a Complete Seed Phrase:

If you have all 12 words, enter them. WalletGen then generates and checks addresses.

### Important Recommendations

*   Seed phrases are always 12 words.
*   Use the * symbol only for missing words.
*   Searching for missing words takes time.
*   Upon recovery, data is saved.
